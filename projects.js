  (In class)
  <br>
PART 1: Think and write about your geologic object – what came before and what may come after it. What sound does it make, what vibrations does it remember? Listen to your object and write 1 page.
<br>
<br>
(After class)
<br>
PART 2:  1-2 pages. Write several scores (or sets of instructions) to be completed with your geologic object. Perform the score.  Document the performance and show it alongside the score, whether it is through writing, photographs, sound recordings, etc.

    Frottage exercise: Do graphite/charcoal rubbings of a series object which will survive us. Do between 5-10, and think about why this particular series of objects. Are they united by place, by memory, are they human-made, organic? Do they exist on vastly different or similar timescales? If you would like to explore color, or other methods of leaving a mark or trace, you are welcome to stray from the graphite/charcoal.
<br><br>
Write a short poem or piece of prose alongside this, one for each. Write also about a collective or individual memory. Can you integrate text into the fossilized object as well?

      Make something durational which extends beyond a human-sized timescale. Think about site / material / speculative fictions. You can express this through photography, drawing, photo collage, photoshop, writing, any media of your choice.

Be prepared to share 1-2 pieces of writing or artwork which engages with your mineral. Where does it come from? Who buys it? What have humans used this for, and for how long? What are its geopolitical dimensions? Be prepared to read this to the class; present your metal/stone to the class in a 5 minute reading that engages at least one other sensory dimension (sound, image… taste if you like… texture)

		content:`PATH ONE
    <br><br>Related to your mineral: transform or translate an existing text – like a legal document, a news article, a data set. Use ink, or scissors, or glue, or heat, or photo processing, or…. Try a process you haven’t done before.
    For both assignments: Write down a list of as many relevant verbs as you can think of in 10 minutes. Post this list to canvas.
    <br><br>Potential resources
    <li>https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/find-mrds-graded.php
    <li>Google News (search for your mineral, or things very adjacent to your mineral)
    <li>The library / used book store
     
    <br><br>
    PATH TWO (for those who need respite from making)
    <br>
    Think about transformation at a broader scale. Think of a few possible things thing you want to do this week which would help people get what they deserve / their needs met. Think of one way that you could help do that for yourself. Do those things. Won’t ask you to turn this in. But do write about what a sustainable practice of transformation looks like, about 1-2 paragraphs.

Taking a moment to reflect on poems such as Kamau Braithwaite's BREAD, or Laura Moriarty's PERSONAL VOLCANO, can you pay extra attention to the shape of your poem?

		content:`Inspired by Damian Zucconi, Meiko Shiomi, Queering the Map, and other projects, can you take an existing map and tracing paper and create a new concrete poem derived from it? 
    <br><br>
    First, you might trace + write only the text as it is. Think: What is missing from the original map? What could be named something else? What should not be represented on this map?
 <br><br>Next, take 1-2 of the names, and using a computer or phone, research the background of that place. Could use Native-Land.ca, or something else. What is it called now, what did it used to be called? When did that change? Have there been any efforts to rename? Take some notes
Write a short poem about your findings.<br><br>
Finally, using a second sheet of tracing paper on the original map, rewrite the original text and with your own text. Erase, delete, modify, or respell to create your counter-cartographic poem.
